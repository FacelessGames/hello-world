The Hello World project is a time-honored tradition in computer programming. It is a simple exercise that gets you started when learning something new. Letâ€™s get started with GitHub!

My name is Riley. I am a student studying at the University of Michigan school of engineering and developer working at the Abilty Lab. I enjoy programming in C++, Java, Python, Matlab, and R! Hopefully I will learn more languages to add to my programming skillset.
